# Heart Failure Prediction Machine Learning

## Problem Domain

Heart failure isn't always easy to predict and it affects so many people, so I thought
giving a machine learning model this data would be cool. 

## Data

This specific dataset contains various factors that contribute to heart failure
such as diabetes, alcohol consumption, blood sugar levels, and more. It also includes
whether or not the patient has heart failure, making it the perfect candidate for machine 
learning.

## Experimental Design

I will be training a model to predict a patient's heart function by giving it some feature data such as
resting ecg, resting bp, cholesterol, and physical activity level. I will then use the heart failure (yes/no),
as the target data. 

## Discussion

I may need to make sure each row I use has valid columns (yes/no and numeric values) and make sure these numbers make
sense logically. If the specific columns I decided to use don't work as well, I can always add more columns since this 
dataset has so many different factors that may or may not be attributed to heart failure.
